# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was created to prepare for the upcoming bootcamp. It is a simple webpage that displays information and acts as a study guide for students about to enter the bootcamp. Students can easily study not only the content of the webpage, but also the webpage's inner workings as well in order to learn more about topics such as HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. This project gave me an in-depth introduction to some of the topics I will be learning soon.
